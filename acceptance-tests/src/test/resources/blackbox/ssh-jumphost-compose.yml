# This file is executed via TestContainers framework.
# It aims to define the test environment of Chutney's acceptances tests.
#
# Chutney server is in a specific network and its exposure is made from 'AcceptanceTests' class.
#
# For SSH tests, we define 2 services :
#   * jump-host : A ssh service with shell and which is meant to be accessible via Chutney network on port 22.
#   * intern-host : A ssh service with shell and which is meant to be accessible only by the jump-host on port 22.
# Access keys are in test resources under blackbox/env/ssh directory.
# see https://github.com/threatpatrols/docker-sshjumphost
